# Michael Scott
 Michael Scott is a Virtual Assistant made using Python 3. The name has been inspired by one of my favourite TV shows THE OFFICE (US).

So the assistant pretty much does all the basic things you say to it. Such as:
- Opens YouTube
- Opens Google
- Tells the time
- Opens VS Code
- Opens Spotify 
- Searches and Speaks Wikipedia
- Tells Stuff about Michael Scott(The Office) like colleagues, about himself and few of Micheal Scott's best jokes
