# Michael Scott
 Michael Scott is a Virtual Assistant made using Python 3. The name has been inspired by one of my favourite TV shows THE OFFICE (US).

So the assistant pretty much does all the basic things you say to it. Such as:
- Opens YouTube
- Opens Google
- Opens StackOverflow
- Tells the time
- Opens VS Code(should be downladed)
- Opens Spotify (should be downloaded)
- Opens PowerShell
- Searches and Speaks Wikipedia Info
- Opens Netflix
- Tells Stuff about Michael Scott(The Office) like colleagues, about himself and few of Micheal Scott's best jokes
- Responds to Hello, Goodbye and Great

Going to add some other functionalities later and will be updating it regularly!
